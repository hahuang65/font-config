# Fonts

My personal repository of fonts I like.
It also includes a script to install them to the correct location, based on the running OS.
I do NOT own these fonts, so if you want to download them from me, PLEASE double check the fonts licenses.

## Usage

Run `./install.sh` to install the font files to the proper location
